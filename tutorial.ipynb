    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "variable_name = variable_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The value is then saved to that variable name can then be referenced later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable values are categorized by data type, which describes what the variable is.\n",
    "In Python there are three basic data types integers, floats and booleans, which are sometimes called primitive types.\n",
    "- Integers are whole numbers without a decimal, and can be positive or negative, for example `x = -3`.\n",
    "- Floating point values or floats are numerical values with decimals, and can also be declared in scientific notation, ex: `T = 346.1` or `dH = 1.56e5` where the number following `e` is raised to the power of 10.\n",
    "- Booleans are the logical values `True` and `False`, and come into play more when discussing control flow.\n",
    "When declaring a variable in Python the data type can be specified with a \"type hint\", which indicates to users and the interpreter what data type the variable is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for a type signature is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "variable_name: variable_type = variable_value\n",
